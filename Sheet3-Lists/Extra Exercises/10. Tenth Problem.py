#10. Write a program that takes in a list of tuples representing (name, age) pairs, and returns a dictionary with the names as keys and ages as values.(the problem itself)
#Declaring the list of tuples with name, age pairs 
NameAgesList = [('Mohammed', 23) , ('Ahmed' , 28) , ('Talal', 40)]
#Initializing an empty dictionary named D 
D = {}
#putting the name, age data in the dictionary D 
for name, age in NameAgesList:
    D[name] = age 
#printing the dictionary D
print(D)
